                    <p>Packed with fast-paced, turn-based RPG action, fourth-wall-breaking, trope-demolishing dialogue, and more item, weapon, and costume customization than you can shake a Lvl. 1 Stick at, Gamindustri is a world set on turning the concept of the JRPG on its head!</p>

                    <h2>Rebirth 2</h2>
                    <p>Gamindustri has been taken over by a new threat, and the CPUs are nowhere to be found! It’s now up to their younger sisters to step into the spotlight and save the day in this hilarious, deeply customizable JRPG!</p>

                    <h2>Rebirth 3</h2>
                    <p>Lost in an alternate dimension, Neptune must collect enough shares to get back home. Sounds easy – except the Seven Sages want to rid Gamindustri of CPUs, including Neptune! Help defeat them and return her to her own world in this JRPG – or be stuck in the '80s forever!</p>
