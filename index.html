                <h1>Welcome to Gamindustri</h1>
                <p>A world protected by four goddesses, known as CPUs.
                    These four CPUs are locked in a conflict with one another for world domination.
                    Later, this battle would come to be known as the Console War.
                    The land where humans reside has been overwhelmed by monsters released
                    by someone known as Arfoire.
                    
                    During the Console War, one of the goddesses Neptune was defeated by the other three,
                    and was exiled from Celestia to the lower realm.
   

                    It is there that Neptune meets IF and Compa.
                    Under the guidance of Histoire, she begins her journey to explore
                    the four lands of Gamindustri...</p>

                <h2>Purle Heart</h2>
                <p>As Purple Heart, Neptune turns very serious and loses her ditzy attitude and friendly disposition at first. Showing a more confident, mature, prideful self instead. She loves a good fight and does not give up until winning.</p>

                <h2>White Heart</h2>
                <p>Blanc's HDD Form. Known to being the most violent of the four Goddesses with a temper to match, she seems the least changed between forms in terms of personality, other then the fact she gets much angrier quicker.</p>
